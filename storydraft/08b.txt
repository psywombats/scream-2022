BRAULIO: "Oh hey Ariel. You're awake?"
ARIEL: "Yeah... How long was I out? Where is everyone?"
BRAULIO: "Only an hour. But Noemi was able to perceive your dream just fine. It was my goat story, right?"
ARIEL: "Sorry. It's what Sumi gave me."
BRAULIO: "Weird. But, once the lawyers clear everything on her end, we'll finally have funding. I'd want to throw a party if there wasn't so much work to get to, haha."
ARIEL: "That's a relief."
BRAULIO: "I'm going to make sure Sumi has everything she needs in the empty office. Feel free to take it easy for the rest of the day -- you've done a bunch already."
BRAULIO: "...And thanks again for showing Sumi around. I love that she's helping us out, but something about her..."
BRAULIO: "Never mind! Catch me in the office if you need anything!"
