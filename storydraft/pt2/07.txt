BRAULIO: "Ariel? Are you alright? You're breathing pretty hard."
ARIEL: "I'm fine. I'm not sure about this dream though."
SUMI: "Did you Grandmother? Or me?"
ARIEL: "Only you. The ending might be abrupt. I'm sorry. This probably isn't a good dream to work with."
SUMI: "That's fine."
ARIEL: "Maybe I should retry."
SUMI: "You've already failed once. How many tries does this usually take? Just play back the dream, please."
BRAULIO: "You're the boss! Here, put this over your eyes, and then take this tablet."
SUMI: "I'm excited. Let's begin."
BRAULIO: "Sweet dreams!"
ARIEL: "Is she under?"
BRAULIO: "Looks like it. She'll enter REM sleep soon and then I'll turn this on."
ARIEL: "It's really not a pleasant dream."
BRAULIO: "I'm pretty sure any dream I'd have about that woman would be a nightmare."
ARIEL: "What was that earlier about oneirophrenia? What is it, and why wasn't I told about it?"
BRAULIO: "I'm really sorry about that. Really! But it shouldn't affect you because you're just the dreamer, not the receiver, right?"
ARIEL: "You didn't answer what it is. And you might not be able to tell, but I'm upset about this."
BRAULIO: "It..."
BRAULIO: "Sumi said it before. Too much Bluepill and you'll mix up dreams and reality. Too long asleep, you might experience, um... I think you said it before. Ego death."
BRAULIO: "Loss of personhood. No identity."
ARIEL: "Is this why Chris left?"
BRAULIO: "He hasn't left for good. And no, I don't think this is why he's taking a break, at least not directly."
ARIEL: "Then why isn't he here?"
BRAULIO: "I think he did what he did because he cares very deeply about you and Noemi. That's all I - "
SUMI: "Eyaaah! Ahh! Ampio aho! Ampio!"
ARIEL: "Sumi! Braulio, unhook her!"
ARIEL: "Sumi, wake up. You're fine. You're right here."
SUMI: "Iza iano? Who?"
BRAULIO: "Is she okay?"
SUMI: "How did..."
SUMI: "Ha... Ariel and Braulio. It's just you two."
ARIEL: "I knew that dream wasn't lucid. I hope I'm not losing my touch."
SUMI: "I saw... her. She..."
SUMI: "Go away. Let me catch my breath."
BRAULIO: "I'm really sorry about this Ms. Chey!"
SUMI: "Who is Sara?"
ARIEL: "I don't know any Saras, sorry."
BRAULIO: "Can I get you something to drink?"
SUMI: "Just... leave me alone."
ARIEL: "I'm going to talk to Noemi. Look after Sumi, okay?"
BRAULIO: "Got it."
