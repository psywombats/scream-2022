ARIEL: "Braulio?"
BRAULIO: "Oh! Hi! Ariel, right?"
ARIEL: "You sound like Noemi, trying to ID me my voice instead of my face."
BRAULIO: "Haha. Nah, my hearing's nowhere as good as hers."
ARIEL: "Her hearing is atrocious. Everything's filtered through her dream consciousness."
BRAULIO:" Do.. do you think that's weird?"
ARIEL: "Noemi? Everything about her is weird, but I love her all the same."
BRAULIO: "Yeah, she's great, and I know you two have been through a lot together."
BRAULIO: "Ughh, I'm sorry about this."
ARIEL: "About what?"
BRAULIO: "I'm sorry, I just don't know how to treat you. You're doing you're best for Lucir, and so should I."
BRAULIO: "Things might seem strange for the next week or so, but if you can bear with it until Sumi is out of here... Man, that would help a lot."
BRAULIO: "And this is mirroring demo thing, uh, well, is kind of in the contract. Sorry."
