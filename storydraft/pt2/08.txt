ARIEL: "I'm at the door, Noemi. It's Ariel. What's the needle?"
NOEMI: "Oh... I think it might be time to say goodbye to Ratricia and Ratilda."
ARIEL: "I suppose euthanasia is probably better than whatever's going on in their little brains."
NOEMI: "No. Ratilda woke up again. She kept slamming into the side of the cage. I think if I left her awake... she'd die quite quickly."
ARIEL: "I'm sorry to hear it."
NOEMI: "Ratthew has it too now. He won't wake up."
ARIEL: "Something has to be going on, but, something else has come up. Have you heard of oneirophrenia?"
NOEMI: "Hm hm. I think you showed me your report on it."
ARIEL: "I don't think so."
NOEMI: "Oh. Of course not. If I read it, it must've been the dream me."
ARIEL: "When was this? Last week? Last month? I'm trying to - "
BRAULIO: "Ariel! Noemi!"
ARIEL: "Slow down. What's going on?"
BRAULIO: "It's Sumi! She broke into Chris's and downed... I don't even know. It was a lot. I think she's in a coma."
ARIEL: "Bluepill?"
BRAULIO: "No, just, everything! Was she trying to poison herself?"
BRAULIO: "I called an ambulance. I don't know what's going on any more. I'm going to try and bring her down to the lobby but she's barely moving."
BRAULIO: "If the EMTs come up here, tell them to go back down. I'll call you as soon as I know anything!"
NOEMI: "Was that... Braulio?"
ARIEL: "Yes. It sounds like something terrible's happened to Sumi."
NOEMI: "I caught that much."
ARIEL: "I'm going to take this time to poke around the lab. I think I'm on the verge of remembering something important, but... I just can't place it."
NOEMI: "It's a familiar feeling."
NOEMI: "I'll be here if you need anything. You seem not yourself today. Please take care of yourself."
