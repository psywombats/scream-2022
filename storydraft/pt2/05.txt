SUMI: "Ariel."
ARIEL: "You called?"
SUMI: "Ahaha. I called and you answered."
ARIEL: "Sorry. I don't understand the joke."
SUMI: "I've been told I have a rotten sense of humor. Don't worry about when I'm laughing. It's usually at nothing."
ARIEL: "Nothing..."
ARIEL: "How late were you here last night, by the way?"
SUMI: "Me? Your colleague Dr. Kowalski said some extremely funny things about me, and then I left."
SUMI: "How late were you here, Ariel?"
ARIEL: "I... don't really remember."
SUMI: "Izay no andrasana."
ARIEL: "Sorry?"
SUMI: "Tsy tadidiko."
ARIEL: "Are you feeling alright?"
SUMI: "Ahaha. Izaho dia."
SUMI: "Speaking of which -- aiza aho?"
ARIEL: "That... isn't Spanish."
SUMI: "Aza manahy momba izany. Next time, right, 'Ariel?'"
SUMI: "Ahaha. HA HA."
ARIEL: "...is she alright?"
