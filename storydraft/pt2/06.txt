BRAULIO: "Hey Sumi! And um, Ariel. If we're ready to go, I'll boot up Gazer."
SUMI: "I can't wait."
BRAULIO: "And you're, uh, really not worried about oneirophrenia?"
SUMI: "If I was, I wouldn't have signed the waiver."
ARIEL: "Oneirophrenia? I don't think I've ever heard that word."
BRAULIO: "Oh. Um."
SUMI: "If the Bluepill dose is incorrect, Braulio explained that mirroring could cause oneirophrenia. The dreamer can't tell the dream from reality."
SUMI: "He also said that you discovered that particular side effect."
ARIEL: "I did? He must've misspoke. Or maybe I - "
ARIEL: "No. Never mind. I'll figure this out later. As long as you're aware of the risks, I'm ready. What should I dream?"
SUMI: "Why not dream about Sumi Chey? This should be a fun little test."
ARIEL: "By Sumi Chey, you mean your grandmother? Or you? I'm not sure if I'll be able to dream about someone I've never met."
SUMI: "If you look at any photo of Grandmother as a young woman, her and I are twins. Whichever works."
ARIEL: "I'll do my best."
