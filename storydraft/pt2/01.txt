ARIEL: "AH!! Ha... Ha."
ARIEL: "Hah."
BRAULIO: "You're awake!"
ARIEL: "I'm awake. Just a dream."
BRAULIO: "Um, do you remember today's date?"
ARIEL: "Monday, April 17th. No, that's when I passed out. Is today Tuesday?"
SUMI: "The 18th of April. Good."
BRAULIO: "And, um, your name. How about your name?"
ARIEL: "It's Ariel."
BRAULIO: "Oh thank the lord."
SUMI: "Ahaha. Well done."
ARIEL: "Sorry, what time is it? I get the feeling I've been out a while."
SUMI: "Almost 5:00 in the afternoon."
BRAULIO: "The Chey Group lawyers are all gone and we've signed the paperwork. I think you were asleep for that?"
ARIEL: "Another mirroring demo?"
BRAULIO: "Something like that! We were trying one of Chris's new drugs, and I'm really glad your back. You have no idea. Really glad."
SUMI: "About Dr. Kowalski..."
BRAULIO: "Oh, um. I guess I should explain this. Chris is on leave for a little while."
ARIEL: "How long?"
BRAULIO: "He wanted some rest. He's in a good place. I think... Um..."
SUMI: "He'll be in touch."
SUMI: "Ariel, in the meantime, why don't you resume your normal work? I'm interested to see how you respond afterwards."
ARIEL: "Afterwards? After what?"
SUMI: "You had an interesting dream, didn't you?"
BRAULIO: "Sorry, Ariel. Sumi just wanted to see the limits of what we've been working on with Gazer, that's all. You had me worried for a minute, but everything's okay now. Haha."
ARIEL: "More mirroring?"
ARIEL: "Sorry, I don't remember today at all."
BRAULIO: "That's probably alright? You've been asleep for a bit."
ARIEL: "And where's Noemi? We've never been able to do mirroring without her, have we?"
BRAULIO: "She's back in her lab, looking after the rats. Maybe, would it be a good idea, maybe you shouldn't talk to her for a while?"
SUMI: "I'm sure it will be fine. Noemi is a special case."
BRAULIO: "Alright."
BRAULIO: "Sorry if the day started out weird, Ariel. Let's try and move things back to normal."
