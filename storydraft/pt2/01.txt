ARIEL: "AH!! Ha... Ha."
ARIEL: "Hah."
BRAULIO: "You're awake!"
ARIEL: "I'm awake. Just a dream."
BRAULIO: "Um, do you remember today's date?"
ARIEL: "Monday, April 17th. No, that's when I passed out. Is today Tuesday?"
SUMI: "The 18th of April. Good."
BRAULIO: "And, um, your name. How about your name?"
ARIEL: "It's Ariel."
BRAULIO: "Oh thank the lord."
SUMI: "Ahaha. Well done."
ARIEL: "Sorry, what time is it? I get the feeling I've been out a while."
SUMI: "Almost 5:00 in the evening."
BRAULIO: "The Chey Group lawyers are all gone and we've signed the paperwork. I think you were asleep for that?"
ARIEL: "Was I trying to record a dream?"
BRAULIO: "Yeah! Sumi's going to try out mirroring."
SUMI: "About Dr. Kowalski..."
BRAULIO: "Oh, um. I guess I should explain this. Chris is on leave for a little while."
ARIEL: "How long?"
BRAULIO: "He wanted some rest. He's in a good place. I think... Um..."
SUMI: "He'll be in touch."
SUMI: "Ariel, in the meantime, the dream is finished? I'll be able to view it?"
ARIEL: "Sorry, your demo? I don't remember today at all. Whatever I was just dreaming about, you definitely shouldn't view that."
BRAULIO: "Oh! Yeah Ariel you definitely should re-record."
ARIEL: "Are you sure about this, Sumi? The Bluepill dose will be a lot higher."
SUMI: "I've signed a waiver and everything. Consider me your first customer."
ARIEL: "Only Noemi and I have tried this before. Where is Noemi anyway?"
BRAULIO: "She's back in her lab, looking after the rats. Maybe, would it be a good idea, maybe you shouldn't talk to her for a while?"
ARIEL: "I need to talk to her."
SUMI: "I'm sure it will be fine. Noemi is a special case."
BRAULIO: "Alright."
SUMI: "I have some calls to make anyway. Come grab me when you're ready to go."
