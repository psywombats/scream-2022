ARIEL: "It's Ratthew... He's still not moving."
ARIEL: "Even if his brain's on overdrive, he's effectively dead."
ARIEL: "Noemi, what drug exactly were you testing on these guys? A new drug from Chris?"
NOEMI: "No... Just Bluepill."
ARIEL: "Then why, only just now, did this happen?"
NOEMI: "Hm hm. We started the mirroring tests recently. I think Ratilda and Ratricia both sent and received dreams."
NOEMI: "But. Ratthew and Ratilda are both fairly old. A long term effect?"
ARIEL: "Is that possible?"
NOEMI: "Find Chris. He would know."
NOEMI: "But you and I have took such huge doses back in the olds days, in the ward. And we're fine."
ARIEL: "I wonder if that's really true."
