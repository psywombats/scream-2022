ARIEL: "I feel bad poking around Chris's office, but... I'm worried about him."
ARIEL: "There are dates in here, and a lot of illustrations and sentence fragments. A diary?"
ARIEL: "June 9th... Teeth fell out again."
ARIEL: "June 11th... Back in Ward #9. Lucid, but still couldn't talk to any of the kids."
ARIEL: "June 12th... Another forest. Save for Gazer."
ARIEL: "June 15th... I die. There's a sense of relief. Can finally talk to the kids."
ARIEL: "It's a dream journal, then. There are tons of discs in the back, too, like we'd feed into Gazer."
ARIEL: "I guess he recorded every dream he's ever had, and then handed us the good ones to use with Gazer."
ARIEL: "The rest of these are pretty dark."
