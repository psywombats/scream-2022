ARIEL: "It's dated two years ago and the name says... Sara Andrianami?"
ARIEL: "Is that a fake name? Or is that the real name of the person calling herself Sumi?"

ARIEL: "And if Sumi was a fake, it seems very out of character for her to be so careless as to keep around a photo of herself under her real name."
