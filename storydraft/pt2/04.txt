ARIEL: "Hey, Noemi? You here? It's Ariel."
NOEMI: "Oh. It's Ariel."
ARIEL: "Sorry. I know it's just me that barges into your lab every day."
NOEMI: "No, no that's fine. I like it when you're here. I just couldn't place you."
ARIEL: "Place me?"
NOEMI: "I thought you were Chris, here with the next Bluepill analog."
ARIEL: "Sorry, it's only me. What happened yesterday?"
NOEMI: "Yesterday?
ARIEL: "Late last night, there was... Never mind, I can't describe it. But I can't remember anything that happened today. There were lawyers here?"
NOEMI: "Hm hm. There were lots of visitors. I wouldn't know if they were lawyers because I was in the lab the whole time. There was a siren, but I think I dreamed that."
NOEMI: "Do... do you know where Chris is?"
ARIEL: "Braulio said he was on leave. I talked with him a bit last night, and I'm not sure I should be the one saying it, but..."
ARIEL: "He said he might leave Lucir. And he said if Sumi funded us, that might be more likely."
NOEMI: "I'm worried."
ARIEL: "About Chris?"
NOEMI: "I met him in the dream world, and he seemed... very sad."
ARIEL: "The last time I remember talking to him, he sounded on the verge of a breakthrough."
NOEMI: "I dreamt that he came to the lab and asked me to forgive him."
ARIEL: "For what?"
NOEMI: "For Ward #9, I think. If he had never existed, or never synthesized Bluepill... You and I would've never ended up there."
ARIEL: "Those are a lot of 'ifs.' He never had anything to do with us, or that trial. He's a chemist, not a psychiatrist, and definitely not one of those demons in white that experimented on kids."
NOEMI: "I want to agree, but..."
ARIEL: "But what?"
NOEMI: "Hm. Haha. I found a bug."
ARIEL: "Noemi?"
NOEMI: "In face recognition. I think I understand most of what's going on now. I'm going to focus on my dream self, and she'll fix the bug. Okay?"
ARIEL: "Alright."
ARIEL: "Noemi? Please remember though. You and I aren't lab rats any more. We're free. If there's nothing for us here at Lucir, we can quit and walk free the next day."
ARIEL: "...Noemi?"
NOEMI: "Hm hm. Always sitting in your corner. Ariel, Ariel. Floating above the rest of us..."
ARIEL: "I'll see you once you wake up. Look after yourself, Noemi."
