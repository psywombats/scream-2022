SUMI: "Miala tsiny fa tsy hitako teo ianao."
ARIEL: "Sorry?"
SUMI: "Sorry what?"
ARIEL: "I didn't catch what you said."
SUMI: "I asked what you were up to and you looked at me like I had grown an extra head."
ARIEL: "You must've slipped into some other language. It's not a big deal."
SUMI: "Ahaha. I must've coughed on my delivery. I only know English and the Latin the nuns beat into me in grammar school."
ARIEL: "If you say so."
ARIEL: "Everything in the temporary office looks good? You'll be able to work there for a few days?"
SUMI: "It's not perfect, but it'll work. Besides, I'm much more interested in learning how things work at Lucir."
SUMI: "This is a bit random, but I love that crystal pendant you're wearing. Where did you get that?"
ARIEL: "Oh, this?"
ARIEL: "I..."
ARIEL: "Sorry, I don't remember. I think I've always been wearing this."
SUMI: "It suits you well."
ARIEL: "It's quartz. Cold, solid, regular. I like it."
SUMI: "But sharp edges though."
ARIEL: "Fair enough."
SUMI: "Ahaha, I really do like you Ariel. You don't flinch. I'm looking forward to seeing you around for the next few weeks."
ARIEL: "Well, I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say we appreciate your investment. Welcome to Lucir."
SUMI: "Rehefa avy eo."
ARIEL: "You too?"
