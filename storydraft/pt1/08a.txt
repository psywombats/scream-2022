BRAULIO: "So how should we do this?"
CHRIS: "If you don't mind, Ms. Chey, mirroring isn't quite ready for commercial use. So far only Ariel and Noemi have pulled it off."
ARIEL: "How about Sumi gives me a story. I'll enter a lucid dream and record it with Gazer. Then we'll enable mirroring playback, and Noemi will view it. Think of it like a challenge."
SUMI: "I like the sound of that."
NOEMI: "Ariel's dreams are always so detailed... This should be easy."
ARIEL: "Then, Sumi, what should I dream? You can whisper to me. Noemi's half-asleep so her hearing's awful anyway."
SUMI: "Hmm... How about a dream about a mountaintop. There are two goats on this mountaintop. But one pushes the other, and it falls to its death. Can you dream that?"
ARIEL: "...I can try."
CHRIS: "Here's the Bluepill."
BRAULIO: "I'll get the electrodes hooked up."
NOEMI: "Good luck Ariel. I know you can do it."
