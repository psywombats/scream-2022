CHRIS: "Braulio! I'm glad I caught you before you left."
BRAULIO: "You aren't usually here this late. What's up?"
CHRIS: "I knew I'd heard of Sumi Chey before. Look, here's an article on her."
BRAULIO: "Wait... That isn't her. That's an old woman."
CHRIS: "Sumi Chey is almost ninety years old. She's not an heiress or anything like that. She founded the whole damn congolomerate."
BRAULIO: "Then that woman who was here today..."
CHRIS: "They're not Sumi Chey. They're an imposter. Almost certainly a corporate spy from some overseas lab looking to steal Gazer."
SUMI: "Incorrect."
BRAULIO: "Sumi!"
CHRIS: "I thought you'd left."
BRAULIO: "How much of that did you, um..."
SUMI: "You should find a more private meeting space next time, Dr. Kowalski."
BRAULIO: "Uhh, heh heh, nice weather?"
SUMI: "You're holding a picture of my grandmother, by the way. We share a name."
CHRIS: "You expect us to believe that?"
SUMI: "While I can't let you speak to her directly, feel free to contact anyone on the Chey Group board if you need them to officially confirm my identity."
SUMI: "Or ask me anything about company. Anything Grandmother knew, I know. I am in every way her successor."
CHRIS: "There certainly weren't any articles about that..."
SUMI: "We're very private. And Grandmother doesn't want her health in the news."
BRAULIO: "We're really sorry about the misunderstanding, Ms. Chey."
SUMI: "No need to worry."
SUMI: "Probably."
SUMI: "Ahaha, have a good night. I'll be back in the morning with a few of my people from legal. Bye now!"
SUMI: "And good night to you, Ariel."
ARIEL: "Ah! Good night."

BRAULIO: "Well that was embarassing."
CHRIS: "I'm still not sure about her."
BRAULIO: "You're going to check her story?"
CHRIS: "Sure will. And I say it's 50/50 she comes back tomorrow."
BRAULIO: "I think we can trust her. This is just a misunderstanding, right?"
CHRIS: "Oh, Ariel. I didn't see you. I'll be in the lab later to talk about..."
CHRIS: "I'll be in my lab. Good night, Braulio."
BRAULIO: "I'm taking off. Thank you so much for everything today Ariel! And I'm sure Sumi will back tomorrow with funding papers. Good night!"
