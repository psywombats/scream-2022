CHRIS: "Ariel. I was hoping you were still around."
ARIEL: "You found something with the new formula?"
CHRIS: "No. This is about _____."
ARIEL: "...Sorry. Can you say that again?"
CHRIS: "_____. Are you absolutely sure your report hasn't leaked outside Lucir? Is there any way Sumi Chey could know about it?"
ARIEL: "I'm sorry, I really don't get what you're talking about."
CHRIS: "What? Well, I dug up some more information on long-term Bluepill use. There are other labs out there working on applications of Bluepill, and nothing as benign as Gazer."
CHRIS: "Actually, tonight, wait until Braulio and Sumi are gone, and meet me at the downstairs computer lab. I need to look up more on the Chey Group."
