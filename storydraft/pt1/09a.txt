ARIEL: "How's it going? You look tense."
BRAULIO: "I'm alright. It's probably just the third coffee of the day kicking in, haha."
BRAULIO: "I was just reading up on some of the other companies the Chey group has invested in."
ARIEL: "...Shouldn't you have done that beforehand?"
BRAULIO: "Maybe. But I couldn't find any. As far as I know, they haven't supplied venture capital to any other startups."
BRAULIO: "All of these companies are outright owned by the central holdings group, and they're all in heavy industry. No tech or bio tech to be found. Is that bad?"
BRAULIO: "Sorry, I'm just really nervous about underdelivering."
ARIEL: "It's fine. Sumi saw the mirroring demo, right?"
BRAULIO: "She seems really interested in crafting specific dreams, or something like that. I may have mentioned the editor project I was working on."
ARIEL: "Dream editing? Does that actually work?"
BRAULIO: "No. I sort of gave up on it once you and Noemi got mirroring working. Why edit dreams when you can craft new ones in realtime, right?"
ARIEL: "Does Sumi think we're going to try and develop the editor?"
BRAULIO: "I don't know. I don't really feel like asking. Maybe I'll start working on editing again, once we've got the new Gazer prototype built."
ARIEL: "Sounds good."
