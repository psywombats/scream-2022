ARIEL: "Noemi? Noemi wake up. Sumi wants to meet you."
ARIEL: "Noemi, come on."
SUMI: "She's asleep standing up?"
ARIEL: "You can never really tell with Noemi."
ARIEL: "Noemi!"
SUMI: "This looks like a bad time."
ARIEL: "It's as good as any. She's always like this."
NOEMI: "Like what?"
ARIEL: "There you are. Noemi, Sumi wanted to meet you."
SUMI: "Braulio mentioned you. It's my pleasure."
ARIEL: "Noemi, Sumi's trying to shake hands."
NOEMI: "Ah. Nice to meet you, Sumi."
SUMI: "I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were blind."
NOEMI: "It's not that I'm... Ariel can explain."
ARIEL: "She's asleep at the moment. Vision doesn't quite work the same in dreams as it does when you're awake."
SUMI: "Sorry, she's... sleepwalking?"
NOEMI: "It's more productive this way. Humans waste a third of their life sleeping. But if I can code while I'm asleep..."
SUMI: "How unconventional."
NOEMI: "I've found I code more fluently in a trance than when I'm truly awake. So then why not sleep all the time?"
ARIEL: "She hasn't woken up in a month, probably."
SUMI: "You don't find that... inconvenient?"
NOEMI: "It's waking up that's inconvenient. I'm still experimenting with the sedative dose, and Chris says I've probably developed too much of a tolerance for Bluepill at this point, but..."
NOEMI: "I'm happier like this. I can see whatever I want in a dream, so there's no need to see reality."
SUMI: "If you say so."
NOEMI: "Would you like to meet the rats, too?"
ARIEL: "Noemi, don't show her the rats."
NOEMI: "This is Ratilda. Ratathan is sleep now, but Ratrick should be around here somewhere..."
ARIEL: "See you later, Noemi."
ARIEL: "Sorry, Noemi is a little odd, but she's an old friend of mine, and she programmed Gazer basically from scratch."
ARIEL: "Computational neuroscience is her specialty. All the technology that lets us record and play back brain signals -- that's all her."
SUMI: "Genius and insanity go hand in hand, after all."
ARIEL: "She's not insane, she - "
SUMI: "Ahaha, I'm only joking. She seems like a nice girl. Maybe later I'll have to meet the rats later."
