SUMI: "So, Ariel... Braulio never mentioned what it was exactly that you do at Lucir. Professional tour guide?"
ARIEL: "I help Braulio with the electrical systems. But, I guess more importantly, I dream."
SUMI: "A professional dreamer."
ARIEL: "I've been able to lucid dream since I was a kid. It turns out that in a business like this, that's a useful skill to have."
ARIEL: "I can dream whatever I like. If Braulio wants that island vacation, then I dream of an island. Then we capture it on Gazer, and anyone can replay it. It's called 'mirroring.'"
SUMI: "Then that makes you a professional artist."
ARIEL: "Not really. I've been told my dreams are always cold. It... might be a personality defect of mine."
ARIEL: "Chris, er, Dr. Kowalski has the truly beautiful dreams. They're random, but, they're warm. I'm told my dreams are too precise and clinical."
SUMI: "Nice to meet you then, Ariel. Where to?"
