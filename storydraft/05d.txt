BRAULIO: "Oh hey Ariel. Hello again Sumi."
ARIEL: "And this is the director's office."
SUMI: "I love that statuette on your desk, by the way. Is that a goat?"
BRAULIO: "A mountain goat, to be specific! I love them."
BRAULIO: "I'm pretty big into climbing! Or I was, when I still had time to do anything outside Lucir."
BRAULIO: "When I was a student I took a trip up into the Cascades. I was out on a cliff face probably 2000 feet above the treeline and saw two of those goats up near the summit, on a 70 degree incline."
ARIEL: "They made it to the top?"
BRAULIO: "One did. The other, well, fell and died."
SUMI: "Fun story."
BRAULIO: "Sorry, that was probably really inappropriate. But the point is, they're fearless animals that don't stop until they reach the top. I admire them."
BRAULIO: "Maybe that's why having the Lucir lab in such a high place appealed to me."
SUMI: "The building is very unique. Is this tower owned by Aquila University?"
BRAULIO: "Yep! We're renting floors 37 and 38 from the university."
BRAULIO: "Everyone working here met at Aquila. Noemi and Ariel are graduates, Chris used to teach there, and, uh, well, I dropped out. Creating Lucir was way more important than any degree."
SUMI: "That's a spirit I love to see in founders."
ARIEL: "Sorry to interrupt you, Braulio. We'll get on with the tour and then be back when you're ready."
BRAULIO: "No problem! Thanks for stopping in!"
