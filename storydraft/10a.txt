BRAULIO: "Ariel! Hey Ariel!"
ARIEL: "Something the matter?"
BRAULIO: "Not really, but, um. Okay, maybe."
BRAULIO: "Have you seen the news?"
ARIEL: "I try to stay away from TV."
BRAULIO: "You could also look outside the window. There are students down there."
ARIEL: "From Aquila?"
BRAULIO: "Yeah. I guess the school paper ran an article about how Lucir set up shop in the tower. And how we're probably going to be funded by the Chey group."
ARIEL: "And so they've decided this is the second coming of MKULTRA."
BRAULIO: "Haha, well um, something like that!"
BRAULIO: "Turns out if you feed psychedelics to a bunch of lab rats, students don't take that very well."
ARIEL: "You sound dismissive."
BRAULIO: "Haha, yeah, I know that, but..."
BRAULIO: "Ariel, I know I embarassed myself with that stupid story about the goats, and Sumi made fun of me for it, but..."
BRAULIO: "I really do want Lucir to be something positive in the world."
BRAULIO: "I haven't experienced a tenth of what you and Noemi have gone through. I feel like I'm not qualified to work on a technology like this."
BRAULIO: "Maybe all the Aquila students down there don't really understand what we're up to, but I don't want anyone to hate me. Hate us."
ARIEL: "Braulio. Take a breath or two."
BRAULIO: "Ha..."
BRAULIO: "Yeah, you're right, of course. Calm down. I'm sorry I freaked out on you."
ARIEL: "It's alright."
BRAULIO: "You really are a different breed, Ariel. Even Sumi doesn't phase you. Maybe I'm too weak to be a founder."
ARIEL: "You can't think like that. If you were like Sumi and only interested in the money... Noemi and Chris and I wouldn't be here."
ARIEL: "You're human. And everyone here values that."
BRAULIO: "Ariel... Ah you're too kind."
BRAULIO: "I'll go brave the protest and head back to my place."
