ARIEL: "This is the Gazer room."SUMI: "Fascinating. The monitors then... They let you view the replayed dream?"ARIEL: "Not quite. It's impossible to present a dream as true visual information."ARIEL: "Instead we have a bank of clips images that we match to the patient's brain signature. Noemi designed a pretty complex AI to do the wave matching."ARIEL: "Basically, if you take in the combined sum of all the images, your brain will respond in roughly the same way. It gives you an idea of what the patient is experiencing."SUMI: "Ingenious."ARIEL: "Braulio mentioned you wanted a demo. I can set that up, but... You'd need to take a small Bluepill dose."SUMI: "Do I look like a little drug use would scare me off?"ARIEL: "I try not to judge by appearance."SUMI: "Ahaha, you're funny. I like you."SUMI: "Between you and me, this won't be the first time I've tried Bluepill. Now strap me in and show me what Gazer can do."ARIEL: "All done. What did you think?"SUMI: "Frankly? I'm a little underwhelmed. What was the dream supposed to look like?"ARIEL: "That was, umm... Green #5. Dr. Kowalski was the original dreamer. It's supposed to be a surreal forest, I think."SUMI: "I suppose I did see that, but... I don't know why anyone would want to dream about a forest."SUMI: "And who was the woman in red?"ARIEL: "Woman in red? There shouldn't be any other people in that dream."SUMI: "She was speaking something foreign. Not English."ARIEL: "That isn't possible. Dreams can't contain languages that the dreamer doesn't know."SUMI: "Maybe your friend Kowalski dreamt it in some language he knows but I don't, then."SUMI: "Never mind. Thank you for the demo."ARIEL: "Sorry about that. I'll check with Noemi later and see what's going on with that dream."
