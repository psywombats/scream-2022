## Screamjam 2022!

Let's do it!

## Git setup instructions for non-technical people (Windows)

Copy/pasted a million times, and here once more:

1. Download and install git for windows https://git-scm.com/download/win -- install it by hitting "next" a bunch of times

2. Download tortoisegit (https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/wiki/Download)

3. Rightclick where you want to dump the project and select "Git clone..."

4. For the URL enter https://github.com/psywombats/scream-2022

5. Cool you have read access now! Whenever you want, rclick somewhere in the directory and do a Git Pull to sync with the repo. We only have one branch so expect things to break all the damn time.

### I want to play the unity game

B6: Install UnityHub. See https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStartedInstallingHub.html .

B7. Install Unity version 2021.2.11f1 from https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive by clicking that version and then allowing it to open in UnityHub

B7: Launch the hub, add the scream-2022/scream-2022 (as in, the folder with the same name inside the main folder) as a project, load that up. LOADING PLEASE WAIT

B8: File -> Open Scene... -> Scenes/Title.unity

B9: Hit the play button up top. If you want to do more (commit, muck with assets, debug stuff) you'll need a unity crashcourse first beyond the scope of this dinky readme
